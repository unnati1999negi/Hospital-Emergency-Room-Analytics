# Hospital Emergency Room Analytics 🏥

## 📊 Project Overview  
This Power BI project visualizes key performance metrics for hospital emergency rooms, providing insights into patient admissions, wait times, satisfaction scores, and referral patterns. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of ER operations to help optimize resource allocation and improve patient outcomes.  

### Objectives:
- Measure **total number of patients visiting the ER** daily and track trends over time.  
- Calculate and visualize **average wait times** to identify operational inefficiencies.  
- Analyze **patient satisfaction scores** to highlight areas for service improvement.  
- Track **patient referrals to departments** and analyze departmental load distribution.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
The dashboard incorporates critical KPIs aligned with business requirements to enhance ER performance and operational efficiency:
1. **Number of Patients** – Displays daily patient visits with area sparklines, tracking patterns over time to identify peak days or seasonal trends.  
2. **Average Wait Time** – Visualizes daily fluctuations in patient wait times, highlighting days requiring operational adjustments.  
3. **Patient Satisfaction Score** – Tracks daily satisfaction levels, correlating with wait times and peak hours to identify service gaps.  
4. **Number of Patients Referred** – Measures referrals to different departments, providing insights into departments requiring additional resources.  
5. **Timeliness** – Tracks the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes, ensuring ER efficiency targets are met.

## 🚀 Dashboards & Views  
The project features **three dashboards** that address various levels of data aggregation and analysis:

### 1. Monthly View  
- **Objective**: Monitor key metrics and trends month-by-month to identify patterns and improvement areas.  
- **Charts Developed**:  
  - Patient Admission Status (Admitted vs. Non-admitted)  
  - Patient Age Distribution (Grouped by 10-year intervals)  
  - Department Referrals  
  - Timeliness (Patients seen within 30 minutes)  
  - Gender and Racial Demographics  
  - Time Analysis (Patient volume by hour and day)  

### 2. Consolidated View  
- **Objective**: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.  
- **Charts Developed**: Aggregates similar metrics as Monthly View, but for customizable periods to capture broader trends and performance insights.  

### 3. Patient Details  
- **Objective**: Offer detailed insights into patient-level data for granular analysis and troubleshooting.  
- **Charts Developed**: Grid display including:  
  - Patient ID  
  - Patient Full Name  
  - Gender  
  - Age  
  - Admission Date  
  - Race  
  - Wait Time  
  - Department Referral  
  - Admission Status
